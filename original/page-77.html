						A scholar loves a widow lady, who, being enamoured of

 her in the snow. He afterwards by a stratagem
 causes her to stand for a whole day in July, naked

						Dearest ladies, it happens oftentimes that the artful scorner
      meets his match; wherefore
      'tis only little wits that delight to scorn. In a series of stories we have heard
      tell of tricks played without aught in the way of reprisals
      following: by mine I purpose in some degree to excite your compassion
      for a gentlewoman of our city (albeit the retribution that
      came upon her was but just) whose flout was returned in the like
      sort, and to such effect that she well-nigh died thereof. The which
      to hear will not be unprofitable to you, for thereby you will learn to
      be more careful how you flout others, and therein you will do very
      wisely.</p>

						'Tis not many years since there dwelt at Florence a lady young
 and fair, and of a high spirit, as also of right gentle lineage, and
 tolerably well endowed with temporal goods. Now Elena--such
 was the lady's name--being left a widow, was minded never to marry
 again, being enamoured of a handsome young gallant of her own
 choosing, with whom she, recking nought of any other lover, did, by
 the help of a maid in whom she placed much trust, not seldom speed
 the time gaily and with marvellous delight. <a name="005" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=005#005">[

						Meanwhile it so befell
 that a young nobleman of our city, Rinieri by name, who had spent
 much time in study at Paris, not that he might thereafter sell his
 knowledge by retail, but that he might learn the reasons and causes
 of things, which accomplishment shews to most excellent advantage
 in a gentleman, returned to Florence, and there lived as a citizen in
 no small honour with his fellows, both by reason of his rank and of
 his learning. <a name="006" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=006#006">[ 
							006
							]</a>
						But as it is often the case that those who are most
 versed in deep matters are the soonest mastered by Love, so was it
 with Rinieri. For at a festal gathering, to which one day he went,
 there appeared before his eyes this Elena, of whom we spoke, clad in
 black, as is the wont of our Florentine widows, and shewing to his
 mind so much fairer and more debonair than any other woman that
 he had ever seen, that happy indeed he deemed the man might call
 himself, to whom God in His goodness should grant the right to hold
 her naked in his arms. <a name="007" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=007#007">[ 
							007
							]</a>
						So now and again he eyed her stealthily, and
 knowing that boons goodly and precious are not to be gotten without
 trouble, he made up his mind to study and labour with all assiduity
 how best to please her, that so he might win her love, and thereby
 the enjoyment of her.</p><h3>[Voice:

						The young gentlewoman was not used to keep her eyes bent
 ever towards the infernal regions; but, rating herself at no less, if not
 more, than her deserts, she was dexterous to move them to and fro,
 and thus busily scanning her company, soon detected the men who
 regarded her with pleasure. By which means having discovered
 Rinieri's passion, she inly laughed, and said: 'Twill turn out that
 'twas not for nothing that I came here to-day, for, if I mistake not,
 I have caught a gander by the bill. <a name="009" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=009#009">[

						So she gave him an occasional
 sidelong glance, and sought as best she might to make him believe
 that she was not indifferent to him, deeming that the more men she
 might captivate by her charms, the higher those charms would be
 rated, and most especially by him whom she had made lord of them
 and her love. <a name="010" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=010#010">[ 
							010
							]</a>
						The erudite scholar bade adieu to philosophical meditation,
 for the lady entirely engrossed his mind; and, having discovered
 her house, he, thinking to please her, found divers pretexts
 for frequently passing by it. <a name="011" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=011#011">[ 
							011
							]</a>
						Whereon the lady, her vanity flattered
 for the reason aforesaid, plumed herself not a little, and shewed herself
 pleased to see him. Thus encouraged, the scholar found means to
 make friends with her maid, to whom he discovered his love, praying
 her to do her endeavour with her mistress, that he might have her
 favour. <a name="012" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=012#012">[ 
							012
							]</a>
						The maid was profuse of promises, and gave her mistress his
 message, which she no sooner heard, than she was convulsed with
 laughter, and replied: 
			“ 
		He brought sense enough hither from
 Paris: knowest thou where he has since been to lose it? Go to,
 now; let us give him that which he seeks. Tell him, when he next
 speaks to you of the matter, that I love him vastly more than he
 loves me, but that I must have regard to my reputation, so that I
 may be able to hold my head up among other ladies; which, if he is
 really the wise man they say, will cause him to affect me much more.

						Ah! poor woman! poor woman! she little knew, my ladies, how
 rash it is to try conclusions with scholars.</p><h3>[Voice:

						The maid found the scholar, and did her mistress's errand. 
<a name="015" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=015#015">[ 
							015

						The
 scholar, overjoyed, proceeded to urge his suit with more ardour, to
 indite letters, and send presents. The lady received all that he sent
 her, but vouchsafed no answers save such as were couched in general
 terms: and on this wise she kept him dangling a long while. 
<a name="016" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=016#016">[ 
							016

						At last,
 having disclosed the whole affair to her lover, who evinced some
 resentment and jealousy, she, to convince him that his suspicions
 were groundless, and for that she was much importuned by the
 scholar, sent word to him by her maid, that never since he had
 assured her of his love, had occasion served her to do him pleasure,
 but that next Christmastide she hoped to be with him; <a name="017" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=017#017">[

						wherefore, if
 he were minded to await her in the courtyard of her house on the
 night of the day next following the feast, she would meet him there as
 soon as she could. <a name="018" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=018#018">[ 
							018
							]</a>
						Elated as ne'er another, the scholar hied him at
 the appointed time to the lady's house, and being ushered into a courtyard
 by the maid, who forthwith turned the key upon him, addressed
 himself there to await the lady's coming.</p><h3>[Voice:

							019

						Now the lady's lover, by her appointment, was with her that
 evening; and, when they had gaily supped, she told him what she had
 in hand that night, adding: 
			“ 
		And so thou wilt be able to gauge the
 love which I have borne and bear this scholar, whom thou hast
 foolishly regarded as a rival.
			” 
		<a name="020" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=020#020">[ 
							020
							]</a>
						The lover heard the lady's words with
 no small delight, and waited in eager expectancy to see her make
 them good. The scholar, hanging about there in the courtyard,
 began to find it somewhat chillier than he would have liked, for it
 had snowed hard all day long, so that the snow lay everywhere
 thick on the ground; however, he bore it patiently, expecting to be
 recompensed by and by. 
<a name="021" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=021#021">[ 
							021
							]</a>
						After a while the lady said to her lover:
 
			“ 
		Go we to the chamber and take a peep through a lattice at him of
 whom thou art turned jealous, and mark what he does, and how he
 will answer the maid, whom I have bidden go speak with him.
			” 
		<a name="022" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=022#022">[ 
							022
							]</a>
						So
 the pair hied them to a lattice, wherethrough they could see without
 being seen, and heard the maid call from another lattice to the
 scholar, saying: 
			“ 
		Rinieri, my lady is distressed as never woman
 was, for that one of her brothers is come here to-night, and after
 talking a long while with her, must needs sup with her, and is not
 yet gone, but, I think, he will soon be off; and that is the reason
 why she has not been able to come to thee, but she will come soon
 now. She trusts it does not irk thee to wait so long.
			” 
		<a name="023" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=023#023">[ 
							023

						Whereto the
 scholar, supposing that 'twas true, made answer: 
			“ 
		Tell my lady to
 give herself no anxiety on my account, until she can conveniently
 come to me, but to do so as soon as she may.
			” 
		<a name="024" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=024#024">[ 
							024
							]</a>
						Whereupon the maid
 withdrew from the window, and went to bed; while the lady said
 to her lover: 
			“ 
		Now, what sayst thou? Thinkst thou that, if I had
 that regard for him, which thou fearest, I would suffer him to tarry
 below there to get frozen?
			” 
		 Which said, the lady and her now
 partly reassured lover got them to bed, where for a great while they
 disported them right gamesomely, laughing together and making
 merry over the luckless scholar.</p><h3>[Voice:

							025
							]</a>
						The scholar, meanwhile, paced up and down the courtyard to
 keep himself warm, nor indeed had he where to sit, or take shelter:
 in this plight he bestowed many a curse upon the lady's brother for
 his long tarrying, and never a sound did he hear but he thought that
 'twas the lady opening the door. But vain indeed were his hopes:
 <a name="026" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=026#026">[

						the lady, having solaced herself with her lover until hard upon midnight,
 then said to him: 
			“ 
		How ratest thou our scholar, my soul?
 whether is the greater his wit, or the love I bear him, thinkst thou?
 Will the cold, that, of my ordaining, he now suffers, banish from thy
 breast the suspicion which my light words the other day implanted
 there?

		<a name="027" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=027#027">[ 
							027

			“ 
		Ay, indeed, heart of my body!
			” 
		 replied the lover, 
			“ 
		well
 wot I now that even as thou art to me, my weal, my consolation,
 my bliss, so am I to thee.

		<a name="028" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=028#028">[ 
							028

			“ 
		So:
			” 
		 quoth the lady, 
			“ 
		then I must
 have full a thousand kisses from thee, to prove that thou sayst
 sooth.
			” 
		
 The lover's answer was to strain her to his heart, and give her not
 merely a thousand but a hundred thousand kisses. 
<a name="029" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=029#029">[ 
							029

						In such converse
 they dallied a while longer, and then: 
			“ 
		Get we up, now,
			” 
		 quoth
 the lady, 
			“ 
		that we may go see if 'tis quite spent, that fire, with
 which, as he wrote to me daily, this new lover of mine used to
 burn.

							030

						So up they got and hied them to the lattice which they had
 used before, and peering out into the courtyard, saw the scholar
 dancing a hornpipe to the music that his own teeth made, a chattering
 for extremity of cold; nor had they ever seen it footed so nimbly
 and at such a pace. Whereupon: 
			“ 
		How sayst thou, sweet my
 hope?

		 quoth the lady. 
			“ 
		Know I not how to make men dance
 without the aid of either trumpet or cornemuse?

						Quoth then the lady:

 quiet, and I will speak to him, and we shall hear what he says,
 which, peradventure, we shall find no less diverting than the sight
 of him.

						So the lady and her lover, who, to his immense delight, had heard
 all that passed, betook them to bed; however, little sleep had they
 that night, but spent the best part of it in disporting themselves and
 making merry over the unfortunate scholar, <a name="040" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=040#040">[

 chattering to such a tune that he seemed to have been metamorphosed
 into a stork, perceived that he had been befooled, and after making
 divers fruitless attempts to open the door and seeking means of egress
 to no better purpose, paced to and fro like a lion, cursing the villainous
 weather, the long night, his simplicity, and the perversity of the

						Slowly the night wore away, and with the first streaks of dawn
 the maid, by her mistress's direction, came down, opened the door of
 the courtyard, and putting on a compassionate air, greeted Rinieri
 with: 
			“ 
		Foul fall him that came here yestereve; he has afflicted us
 with his presence all night long, and has kept thee a freezing out

 to-night shall be another time: well wot I that nought could have
 befallen that my lady could so ill brook.

						For all his wrath, the
 scholar, witting, like the wise man he was, that menaces serve but to
 put the menaced on his guard, kept pent within his breast that which
 unbridled resentment would have uttered, and said quietly, and
 without betraying the least trace of anger:

			“ 
		In truth 'twas the
 worst night I ever spent, but I understood quite well that the lady
 was in no wise to blame, for that she herself, being moved to pity of
 me, came down here to make her excuses, and to comfort me; and,
 as thou sayst, what has not been to-night will be another time:
 wherefore commend me to her, and so, adieu!

 paralysed for cold, he got him, as best he might, home, where, weary
 and fit to die for drowsiness, he threw himself on his bed, and fell
 into a deep sleep, from which he awoke to find that he had all but
 lost the use of his arms and legs. He therefore sent for some
 physicians, and having told them what a chill he had gotten, caused

						But, though they treated him with
 active and most drastic remedies, it cost them some time and no little
 trouble to restore to the cramped muscles their wonted pliancy, and,
 indeed, but for his youth and the milder weather that was at hand,
 'twould have gone very hard with him.</p><h3>[Voice:

 his enmity, feigned to be vastly more enamoured of his widow than

						And so it was that after a while Fortune furnished him
 with an opportunity of satisfying his resentment, for the gallant of
 whom the widow was enamoured, utterly regardless of the love she
 bore him, grew enamoured of another lady, and was minded no more
 to pleasure the widow in aught either by word or by deed; wherefore
 she now pined in tears and bitterness of spirit. <a name="049" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=049#049">[

						However, her
 maid, who commiserated her not a little, and knew not how to dispel
 the dumps that the loss of her lover had caused her, espying the
 scholar pass along the street, as he had been wont, conceived the
 silly idea that the lady's lover might be induced to return to his old
 love by some practice of a necromantic order, wherein she doubted
 not that the scholar must be a thorough adept; which idea she
 imparted to her mistress. <a name="050" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=050#050">[

						The lady, being none too well furnished
 with sense, never thinking that, if the scholar had been an adept in
 necromancy, he would have made use of it in his own behoof, gave
 heed to what her maid said, and forthwith bade her learn of the
 scholar whether he would place his skill at her service, and assure
 him that, if he so did, she, in guerdon thereof, would do his pleasure.
 <a name="051" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=051#051">[

						The maid did her mistress's errand well and faithfully. The scholar
 no sooner heard the message, than he said to himself: Praised be
 Thy name, O God, that the time is now come, when with Thy
 help I may be avenged upon this wicked woman of the wrong she
 did me in requital of the great love I bore her. <a name="052" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=052#052">[

						Then, turning to
 the maid, he said: 
			“ 
		Tell my lady to set her mind at ease touching
 this matter; for that, were her lover in India, I would forthwith
 bring him hither to crave her pardon of that wherein he has offended
 her. As to the course she should take in the matter, I tarry but her
 pleasure to make it known to her, when and where she may think
 fit: tell her so, and bid her from me to be of good cheer.
			” 
		 The
 maid carried his answer to her mistress, and arranged that they should
 meet in the church of Santa Lucia of Prato. <a name="053" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=053#053">[

						Thither accordingly
 they came, the lady and the scholar, and conversed apart, and the
 lady, quite oblivious of the ill-usage by which she had well-nigh done
 him to death, opened all her mind to him, and besought him, if he had
 any regard to her welfare, to aid her to the attainment of her desire.

			“

			“ 
		true it is that among other lore
 that I acquired at Paris was this of necromancy, whereof, indeed, I
 know all that may be known; but, as 'tis in the last degree displeasing
 to God, I had sworn never to practise it either for my own or for any
 other's behoof. <a name="055" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=055#055">[

 matter scarce so easy of performance as, perchance, you suppose,
 most especially when a woman would fain recover the love of a man,

						The lady gave entire credence to the scholar's words, and deeming
 her lover as good as in her arms again, recovered half her wonted
 spirits: wherefore: 
			“

 for their strayed sheep; 'tis a place lonely indeed, and quite out of

						Well pleased to be certified of the lady's intention, the scholar,
 to whom her estate and the tower were very well known, made
 answer: 
			“ 
		I was never in those parts, Madam, and therefore know
 neither your estate nor the tower, but, if 'tis as you say, 'twill certainly

 pray you, when you shall have your heart's desire, and know that
 I have done you good service, do not forget me, but keep your

						The scholar, gleefully
 anticipating the success of his enterprise, fashioned an image, and
 inscribed it with certain magical signs, and wrote some gibberish
 by way of orison, which in due time he sent to the lady, bidding her
 the very next night do as he had prescribed: and thereupon he
 hied him privily with one of his servants to the house of a friend
 hard by the tower, there to carry his purpose into effect. <a name="066" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=066#066">[

						The lady,
 on her part, set out with her maid, and betook her to her estate, and,
 night being come, sent the maid to bed, as if she were minded to go
 to rest herself; and about the hour of first sleep stole out of the
 house and down to the tower, beside the Arno; and when, having
 carefully looked about her, she was satisfied that never a soul was to
 be seen or heard, she took off her clothes and hid them under a bush;
 then, with the image in her hand, she dipped herself seven times in
 the river; which done, she hied her with the image to the tower.

						The scholar, having at nightfall couched himself with his servant
 among the willows and other trees that fringed the bank, marked
 all that she did, and how, as she passed by him, the whiteness of her
 flesh dispelled the shades of night, and scanning attentively her
 bosom and every other part of her body, and finding them very fair,
 felt, as he bethought him what would shortly befall them, some pity
 of her; <a name="068" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=068#068">[

						while, on the other hand, he was suddenly assailed by the
 solicitations of the flesh which caused that to stand which had been
 inert, and prompted him to sally forth of his ambush and take her by
 force, and have his pleasure of her. And, what with his compassion
 and passion, he was like to be worsted; <a name="069" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=069#069">[

						but then, as he bethought
 him who he was, and what a grievous wrong had been done him,
 and for what cause, and by whom, his wrath, thus rekindled, got the
 better of the other affections, so that he swerved not from his resolve,
 but suffered her to go her way.</p><h3>[Voice:

						The lady ascended the tower, and standing with her face to the
 North, began to recite the scholar's orison, while he, having stolen
 into the tower but a little behind her, cautiously shifted the ladder
 that led up to the roof on which the lady stood, and waited to
 observe what she would say and do. <a name="071" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=071#071">[

						Seven times the lady said the
 orison, and then awaited the appearance of the two damsels; and so
 long had she to wait--not to mention that the night was a good deal
 cooler than she would have liked--that she saw day break; whereupon,
 disconcerted that it had not fallen out as the scholar had
 promised, she said to herself: I misdoubt me he was minded to
 give me such a night as I gave him; but if such was his intent, he
 is but maladroit in his revenge, for this night is not as long by a third

 day might not overtake her there, she began to think of descending,
 but, finding that the ladder was removed, <a name="073" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=073#073">[

						she felt as if the world had
 come to nought beneath her feet, her senses reeled, and she fell in a
 swoon upon the floor of the roof. When she came to herself, she
 burst into tears and piteous lamentations, and witting now very well
 that 'twas the doing of the scholar, she began to repent her that she
 had first offended him, and then trusted him unduly, having such
 good cause to reckon upon his enmity; in which frame she abode
 long time. <a name="074" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=074#074">[

						Then, searching if haply she might find some means of
 descent, and finding none, she fell a weeping again, and bitterly to
 herself she said: Alas for thee, wretched woman! what will thy
 brothers, thy kinsmen, thy neighbours, nay, what will all Florence
 say of thee, when 'tis known that thou hast been found here naked?

 doings, will not suffer it. Ah! poor wretch! that at one and the

 the tower with his sheep, she might send him for her maid, for the
 sun was now risen, she approached one of the parapets of the tower,
 and looked out, and so it befell that the scholar, awakening from a
 slumber, in which he had lain a while at the foot of a bush, espied

 the tower, bidding his servant on no account to stir from his post,

 down to wait. And now lost in most melancholy brooding, now
 dissolved in tears, now plunged in despair of ever seeing the scholar

						The husbandman, knowing her by her voice,
 replied: 
			“ 
		Alas! Madam, who set you there? Your maid has
 been seeking you all day long: but who would ever have supposed
 that you were there?
			”

						Whereupon he took the props of the ladder,
 and set them in position, and proceeded to secure the rounds to
 them with withies. Thus engaged he was found by the maid, who,
 as she entered the tower, beat her face and breast, and unable longer
 to keep silence, cried out: 
			“ 
		Alas, sweet my lady, where are you?
			” 
		<a name="139" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=139#139">[

						Whereto the lady made answer as loud as she might: 
			“ 
		O my sister,
 here above am I, weep not, but fetch me my clothes forthwith.
			” 
		<a name="140" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=140#140">[

						Well-nigh
 restored to heart, to hear her mistress's voice, the maid, assisted
 by the husbandman, ascended the ladder, which he had now all but
 set in order, and gaining the roof, and seeing her lady lie there
 naked, spent and fordone, and liker to a half-burned stump than to a
 human being, she planted her nails in her face and fell a weeping
 over her, as if she were a corpse. 
<a name="141" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=141#141">[

						However, the lady bade her for
 God's sake be silent, and help her to dress, and having learned from
 her that none knew where she had been, save those that had brought
 her her clothes and the husbandman that was there present, was
 somewhat consoled, and besought her for God's sake to say nought
 of the matter to any. 
<a name="142" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=142#142">[

						Thus long time they conversed, and then
 the husbandman took the lady on his shoulders, for walk she could
 not, and bore her safely out of the tower. The unfortunate maid,
 following after with somewhat less caution, slipped, and falling from
 the ladder to the ground, broke her thigh, and roared for pain like
 any lion. 
<a name="143" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=143#143">[

						So the husbandman set the lady down upon a grassy mead,
 while he went to see what had befallen the maid, whom, finding her
 thigh broken, he brought, and laid beside the lady: who, seeing her
 woes completed by this last misfortune, and that she of whom, most
 of all, she had expected succour, was lamed of a thigh, was distressed
 beyond measure, and wept again so piteously that not only was the
 husbandman powerless to comfort her, but was himself fain to weep.
 <a name="144" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=144#144">[

						However, as the sun was now low, that they might not be there
 surprised by night, he, with the disconsolate lady's approval, hied him
 home, and called to his aid two of his brothers and his wife, who
 returned with him, bearing a plank, whereon they laid the maid, and
 so they carried her to the lady's house. There, by dint of cold
 water and words of cheer, they restored some heart to the lady,
 whom the husbandman then took upon his shoulders, and bore to her
 chamber. <a name="145" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=145#145">[

						The husbandman's wife fed her with sops of bread, and
 then undressed her, and put her to bed. They also provided the
 means to carry her and the maid to Florence; and so 'twas done.
 <a name="146" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=146#146">[ 
							146
							]</a>
						There the lady, who was very fertile in artifices, invented an entirely
 fictitious story of what had happened as well in regard of her maid
 as of herself, whereby she persuaded both her brothers and her sisters
 and every one else, that 'twas all due to the enchantments of evil
 spirits. <a name="147" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=147#147">[ 
							147
							]</a>
						The physicians lost no time, and, albeit the lady's suffering
 and mortification were extreme, for she left more than one skin sticking
 to the sheets, they cured her of a high fever, and certain attendant
 maladies; as also the maid of her fractured thigh. <a name="148" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=148#148">[ 
							148
							]</a>
						The end of all
 which was that the lady forgot her lover, and having learned discretion,
 was thenceforth careful neither to love nor to flout; and the
 scholar, learning that the maid had broken her thigh, deemed his
 vengeance complete, and was satisfied to say never a word more of
 the affair. <a name="149" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0807&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=149#149">[ 
							149

						Such then were the consequences of her flouts to this
 foolish young woman, who deemed that she might trifle with a
 scholar with the like impunity as with others, not duly understanding
 that they--I say not all, but the more part--know where the Devil
 keeps his tail. Wherefore, my ladies, have a care how you flout
 men, and more especially scholars.</p><a href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0806&amp;expand=empty&amp;lang=eng" class="prev_link">← Previous</a><a href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0808&amp;expand=empty&amp;lang=eng" class="next_link">Next →</a>
