						Saladin, in guise of a merchant, is honourably entreated
 by Messer Torello. The Crusade ensuing, Messer
 Torello appoints a date, after which his wife may
 marry again: he is taken prisoner, and by training
 hawks comes under the Soldan's notice. The Soldan
 recognizes him, makes himself known to him, and
 entreats him with all honour. Messer Torello falls
 sick, and by magic arts is transported in a single night
 to Pavia, where his wife's second marriage is then to be
 solemnized, and being present thereat, is recognized by
 her, and returns with her to his house.</p><div>

						And were we here for the
 purpose of correcting, or even of censuring, the vices of the age, I
 should add a copious sequel to her discourse; but as we have another
 end in view, it has occurred to me to set before you in a narrative,
 which will be of considerable length, but entertaining throughout,
 an instance of Saladin's magnificence, to the end that, albeit, by reason
 of our vices, it may not be possible for us to gain to the full the
 friendship of any, yet by the matters whereof you shall hear in my
 story we may at least be incited to take delight in doing good offices,
 in the hope that sooner or later we may come by our reward
 thereof.</p>

						I say, then, that in the time of the Emperor Frederic I., as
 certain writers affirm, the Christians made common emprise for the
 recovery of the Holy Land. Whereof that most valiant prince,
 Saladin, then Soldan of Babylonia, being in good time apprised,
 resolved to see for himself the preparations made by the Christian
 potentates for the said emprise, that he might put himself in better
 trim to meet them.  <a name="006" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=006#006">[

						So, having ordered all things to his mind in
 Egypt, he made as if he were bound on a pilgrimage, and attended
 only by two of his chiefest and sagest lords, and three servants, took
 the road in the guise of a merchant.  <a name="007" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=007#007">[

						And having surveyed many
 provinces of Christendom, as they rode through Lombardy with
 intent to cross the Alps, they chanced, between Milan and Pavia, to
 fall in with a gentleman, one Messer Torello d'Istria da Pavia, who
 with his servants and his dogs and falcons was betaking him to a fine
 estate that he had on the Ticino, there to tarry a while.  <a name="008" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=008#008">[

						Now
 Messer Torello no sooner espied Saladin and his lords than he
 guessed them to be gentlemen and foreigners; and, being zealous to
 do them honour, when Saladin asked one of his servants how far
 off Pavia might still be, and if he might win there in time to enter
 the town, he suffered not the servant to make answer, but: 
			“ 
		No,
 gentlemen,
			” 
		 quoth he, 
			“ 
		by the time you reach Pavia 'twill be too
 late for you to enter.

			“ 
		So!
			” 
		 replied Saladin, 
			“ 
		then might you
 be pleased to direct us, as we are strangers, where we may best be
 lodged?
			” 
		
			“ 
		<a name="010" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=010#010">[

						That gladly will I,
			” 
		 returned Messer Torello. 
			“ 
		I
 was but now thinking to send one of these my men on an errand to
 Pavia; I will send him with you, and he will guide you to a place
 where you will find very comfortable quarters.

						Then, turning to
 one of his most trusty servants, he gave him his instructions, and
 despatched him with them: after which, he repaired to his estate,
 and forthwith, as best he might, caused a goodly supper to be made
 ready, and the tables set in his garden; which done, he stationed
 himself at the gate on the look-out for his guests.</p><h3>[Voice: 
			panfilo
			]</h3><p>The servant, conversing with the gentlemen of divers matters,
 brought them by devious roads to his lord's estate without their being
 ware of it.  <a name="012" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=012#012">[

						Whom as soon as Messer Torello espied, he came forth
 afoot to meet them, and said with a smile: 
			“ 
		A hearty welcome to
 you, gentlemen.

						Now Saladin, being very quick of apprehension,
 perceived that the knight had doubted, when he met them, that, were
 he to bid them to his house, they might not accept his hospitality;
 and accordingly, that it might not be in their power to decline it, had
 brought them to his house by a ruse. And so, returning his greeting:
 
			“ 
		Sir,
			” 
		 quoth he, 
			“ 
		were it meet to find fault with those that shew
 courtesy, we should have a grievance against you, for that, to say
 nought of somewhat delaying our journey, you have in guerdon of
 a single greeting constrained us to accept so noble a courtesy as
 yours.

		<a name="014" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=014#014">[

						Whereto the knight, who was of good understanding and
 well-spoken, made answer: 
			“ 
		Gentlemen, such courtesy as we
 shew you will, in comparison of that which, by what I gather from
 your aspect, were meet for you, prove but a sorry thing; but in sooth
 this side of Pavia you might not anywhere have been well lodged;
 wherefore take it not amiss that you have come somewhat out of
 your way to find less discomfortable quarters.

						And as he spoke,
 about them flocked the servants, who, having helped them to dismount,
 saw to their horses; whereupon Messer Torello conducted them to
 the chambers that were made ready for them, where, having caused
 them to be relieved of their boots, and refreshed with the coolest of
 wines, he held pleasant converse with them until supper-time.
  <a name="016" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=016#016">[

						Saladin and his lords and servants all knew Latin, so that they both
 understood and made themselves understood very well, and there
 was none of them but adjudged this knight to be the most agreeable
 and debonair man, and therewithal the best talker, that he had ever
 seen;  <a name="017" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=017#017">[

						while to Messer Torello, on the other hand, they shewed as
 far greater magnificoes than he had at first supposed, whereby he was
 inly vexed that he had not been able that evening to do them the
 honours of company, and a more ceremonious banquet. For which
 default he resolved to make amends on the ensuing morning: wherefore,
 having imparted to one of his servants that which he would have
 done, he sent him to his most judicious and highminded lady at
 Pavia, which was close by, and where never a gate was locked.
  <a name="018" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=018#018">[

						Which done, he brought the gentlemen into the garden, and courteously
 asked them who they were. 
			“ 
		We are Cypriote merchants,
			” 
		
 replied Saladin, 
			“ 
		and 'tis from Cyprus we come, and we are on our
 way to Paris on business.
			” 
		 Quoth then Messer Torello: 
			“ 
		Would
 to God that our country bred gentlemen of such a quality as are the
 merchants that I see Cyprus breeds!
			”

						From which they passed to
 discourse of other matters, until, supper-time being come, he
 besought them to seat them at table; whereat, considering that
 the supper was but improvised, their entertainment was excellent
 and well-ordered.</p><h3>[Voice: 
			panfilo
			]</h3><p>The tables being cleared, Messer Torello, surmising that they
 must be weary, kept them no long time from their rest, but bestowed
 them in most comfortable beds, and soon after went to rest himself.
  <a name="020" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=020#020">[ 
							020

						Meanwhile the servant that he had sent to Pavia did his lord's errand
 to the lady, who, in the style rather of a queen than of a housewife,
 forthwith assembled not a few of Messer Torello's friends and vassals,
 and caused all meet preparation to be made for a magnificent banquet,
 and by messengers bearing torches bade not a few of the noblest of
 the citizens thereto; and had store of silken and other fabrics and
 vair brought in, and all set in order in every point as her husband
 had directed.  <a name="021" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=021#021">[

						Day came, and the gentlemen being risen, Messer
 Torello got him to horse with them, and having sent for his hawks,
 brought them to a ford, and shewed them how the hawks flew.
 By and by, Saladin requesting of him a guide to the best inn at
 Pavia: 
			“ 
		I myself will be your guide,
			” 
		 returned Messer Torello,
 
			“ 
		for I have occasion to go thither.
			” 
		<a name="022" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=022#022">[ 
							022

						Which offer they, nothing
 doubting, did gladly accept, and so with him they set forth; and
 about tierce, being come to the city, and expecting to be directed to
 the best inn, they were brought by Messer Torello to his own house,
 where they were forthwith surrounded by full fifty of the greatest
 folk of the city, gathered there to give the gentlemen a welcome;
 and 'twas who should hold a bridle or a stirrup, while they dismounted.
  <a name="023" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=023#023">[

						Whereby Saladin and his lords more than guessing the
 truth: 
			“ 
		Messer Torello,
			” 
		 quoth they, 
			“ 
		'twas not this that we
 craved of you. Honour enough had we from you last night, and
 far in excess of our desires; wherefore thou mightst very well have
 left us to go our own road.

						Whereto: 
			“ 
		Gentlemen,
			” 
		 replied
 Messer Torello, 
			“ 
		for that which was done yestereve I have to thank
 Fortune rather than you: seeing that Fortune surprised you on the
 road at an hour when you must needs repair to my little house: for
 that which shall be done this morning I shall be beholden to you, as
 will also these gentlemen that surround you, with whom, if you
 deem it courteous so to do, you may refuse to breakfast, if you
 like.

						Fairly conquered, Saladin and his lords dismounted, and heartily
 welcomed by the gentlemen, were conducted to the chambers which
 had been most sumptuously adorned for their use; and having laid
 aside their riding dress, and taken some refreshment, repaired to the
 saloon, where all had been made ready with splendour. There,
 having washed their hands, they sat them down to table, and were
 regaled with a magnificent repast of many courses, served with all
 stately and fair ceremony, insomuch that, had the Emperor himself
 been there, 'twould not have been possible to do him more honour.

						And albeit Saladin and his lords were grandees, and used to exceeding
 great displays of pomp and state, nevertheless this shewed to them
 as not a little marvellous, and one of the greatest they had ever seen,
 having regard to the quality of their host, whom they knew to be
 but a citizen, and no lord.  <a name="027" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=027#027">[ 
							027

						Breakfast done, and the tables cleared,
 they conversed a while of high matters, and then, as 'twas very hot,
 all the gentlemen of Pavia--so it pleased Messer Torello--retired for
 their siesta, while he remained with his three guests; with whom he
 presently withdrew into a chamber, whither, that there might be
 nought that he held dear which they had not seen, he called his
 noble lady.  <a name="028" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=028#028">[ 
							028

						And so the dame, exceeding fair and stately of person,
 and arrayed in rich apparel, with her two little boys, that shewed as
 two angels, on either hand, presented herself before them, and
 graciously greeted them. Whereupon they rose, and returned her
 salutation with reverence, and caused her to sit down among them,
 and made much of her two little boys.  <a name="029" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=029#029">[ 
							029

						But after some interchange
 of gracious discourse, Messer Torello being withdrawn somewhat
 apart, she asked them courteously, whence they came and whither
 they were bound, and had of them the same answer that Messer
 Torello had received.  <a name="030" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=030#030">[

			“ 
		So!
			” 
		 quoth the lady with a joyful air,
 
			“ 
		then I see that my woman's wit will be of service to you; wherefore
 I pray you as a special favour neither to reject nor to despise the
 little gift that I am about to present to you; but reflecting that, as
 women have but small minds, so they make but small gifts, accept it,
 having regard rather to the good will of the giver than the magnitude
 of the gift.

						She then caused bring forth for each of them
 two pair of robes, lined the one with silk, the other with vair, no
 such robes as citizens or merchants, but such as lords, use to wear,
 and three vests of taffeta, besides linen clothes, and: 
			“ 
		Take them,
			” 
		quoth she. 
			“ 
		The robes I give you are even such as I have arrayed
 my lord withal: the other things, considering that you are far from
 your wives, and have come a long way, and have yet a long way to
 go, and that merchants love to be neat and trim, may, albeit they
 are of no great value, be yet acceptable to you.
			” 
		</p><h3>[Voice:

							032

						Wondering, the gentlemen acknowledged without reserve that
 there was no point of courtesy wherein Messer Torello was not
 minded to acquit himself towards them. And noting the lordly
 fashion of the robes, unsuited to the quality of merchants, they misdoubted
 that Messer Torello had recognized them. However, quoth
 one of them to the lady: 
			“ 
		Gifts great indeed are these, Madam,
 nor such as lightly to accept, were it not that thereto we are constrained
 by your prayers, to which we may on no account say, no.

						Whereupon, Messer Torello being now come back, the lady bade
 them adieu, and took her leave of them; and in like manner did she
 cause their servants to be supplied with equipment suitable to them.
 The gentlemen, being much importuned thereto by Messer Torello,
 consented to tarry the rest of the day with him; and so, having
 slept, they donned their robes, and rode a while with him about the
 city; and supper-time being come, they feasted magnificently, and
 with a numerous and honourable company.  <a name="034" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=034#034">[

						And so in due time
 they betook them to rest; and at daybreak, being risen, they found,
 in lieu of their jaded nags, three stout and excellent palfreys, and in
 like manner fresh and goodly mounts for their servants. Which
 Saladin marking turned to his lords, and:  <a name="035" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=035#035">[

			“ 
		By God,
			” 
		 quoth he,
 
			“ 
		never was gentleman more complete and courteous and considerate
 than this Messer Torello, and if the Christian kings are as kingly as
 he is knightly, there is none of them whose onset the Soldan of
 Babylon might well abide, to say nought of so many as we see making
 ready to fall upon him.
			” 
		 However, knowing that 'twas not permissible
 to refuse, he very courteously thanked Messer Torello: and
 so they got them to horse.  <a name="036" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=036#036">[

						Messer Torello with a numerous company
 escorted them far beyond the gate of the city, until, loath
 though Saladin was to part from him, so greatly did he now affect
 him, yet as he must needs speed on, he besought him to turn back.
 Whereupon, albeit it irked him to take leave of them:  <a name="037" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=037#037">[

						Thus parted Saladin and his company from Messer Torello,
 Saladin burning with an exceeding great desire, if life should be continued
 to him, and the war, which he anticipated, should not undo
 him, to shew Messer Torello no less honour than he had received at
 his hands, and conversing not a little with his lords both of Messer
 Torello himself and of his lady, and all that he did and that in any wise
 concerned him, ever more highly commending them.  <a name="040" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=040#040">[

						However,
 having with much diligence spied out all the West, he put to sea,
 and returned with his company to Alexandria; and having now all
 needful information, he put himself in a posture of defence. Messer
 Torello, his mind full of his late guests, returned to Pavia; but,

 anywhere near the truth.</p><h3>[Voice:

						Then with great and general mustering of forces came the time
 for embarking on the emprise, and Messer Torello, heeding not the
 tearful entreaties of his wife, resolved to join therein. So, being fully
 equipped and about to take horse, he said to his lady, whom he most

						Messer Torello took the ring, and got him to horse, and having

 his company at Genoa, he embarked on a galley, and having departed
 thence, in no long time arrived at Acre, and joined the main
 Christian host;  <a name="049" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=049#049">[

 great and mortal sickness; during which, whether owing to Saladin's
 strategy, or his good fortune, he made an easy capture of well-nigh
 all the remnant of the Christians that were escaped, and quartered
 them in divers prisons in many cities;  <a name="050" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=050#050">[

						of which captives Messer
 Torello being one, was brought to Alexandria and there confined.
 Where, not being known, and fearing to make himself known, he,
 under constraint of necessity, applied him to the training of hawks,
 whereof he was a very great master; and thereby he fell under the
 notice of Saladin, who took him out of the prison, and made him his
 falconer.  <a name="051" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=051#051">[

						The Soldan called him by no other name than

 whole soul ever in Pavia, essayed many a time to escape, that he
 might return thither, but still without success:  <a name="052" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=052#052">[

						wherefore, certain
 Genoese, that were come to Alexandria as ambassadors to the Soldan
 for the redemption of some of their townsfolk, being about to return,
 he resolved to write to his lady, how that he lived, and would come
 back to her, as soon as he might, and that she should expect his
 return; and having so done, he earnestly besought one of the
 ambassadors, whom he knew, to see that the letter reached the
 hands of the Abbot of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, who was his
 uncle.</p><h3>[Voice:

						Now, such being the posture of Messer Torello's affairs, it befell
 one day that, while he talked with Saladin of his hawks, he smiled;
 whereby his mouth shaped itself in a fashion, of which Saladin had
 taken particular note, while he was at Pavia. And so, recalling
 Messer Torello to mind, he fixed his gaze upon him, and it seemed
 to him that 'twas indeed Messer Torello; wherefore, leaving the
 matter of which they were conversing: 
			“ 
		Tell me, Christian,
			” 
		
 quoth he, 
			“ 
		of what country art thou in the West?

			“

 poor man, and of humble condition.

						Which when he heard,
 Saladin, well-nigh resolved of his doubt, said joyfully to himself:
 
			“ 
		God has provided me with occasion meet to prove to this man
 what store I set by his courtesy;
			” 
		 and without another word he
 brought him into a room where he kept all his wearing apparel, and
 said: 
			“ 
		Look, Christian, if among these robes there be any that
 thou hast ever seen before.
			” 
		<a name="056" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=056#056">[

						So Messer Torello examined the robes,
 and espied those which his lady had given to Saladin; but, deeming
 they could not be the same, he replied: 
			“ 
		My lord, there is no robe
 here that I recognize, albeit 'tis true that those two robes are such as
 I once wore myself, in company with three merchants that came to
 my house.

		<a name="057" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=057#057">[

						Whereupon Saladin could refrain himself no longer;
 but, tenderly embracing him: 
			“ 
		You,
			” 
		 quoth he, 
			“ 
		are Messer
 Torello d'Istria, and I am one of those three merchants to whom
 your lady gave these robes; and now is the time to warrant you of
 the quality of my merchandise, as, when I parted from you, I told

						Which to hear, Messer Torello was at
 once overjoyed and abashed, overjoyed to have entertained so illustrious
 a guest, and abashed, for that it seemed to him that he
 had given him but a sorry entertainment. To whom: 
			“ 
		Messer
 Torello,

			“

						And so
 they made great cheer together; and then Saladin caused Messer
 Torello to be royally arrayed; and presented him to all his greatest
 lords, and having extolled his merit in no stinted measure, bade
 all, as they hoped for grace from him, honour Messer Torello
 even as himself. And so from that hour did they all; but most
 especially the two lords that had been with Saladin at Messer Torello's
 house.</p><h3>[Voice:

						The glory, to which Messer Torello thus suddenly found himself
 raised, somewhat diverted his mind from the affairs of Lombardy,

 there died and was buried one Messer Torello de Dignes, an obscure
 knight of Provence, whereas Messer Torello d'Istria was known to
 all the host for a right noble gentleman, whoso heard tell that
 Messer Torello was dead, supposed that 'twas Messer Torello d'Istria,
 and not Messer Torello de Dignes; nor did what happened after,

						The mode and measure of his
 lady's grief, her mourning, her lamentation, 'twere tedious to describe.
 Enough that, after some months spent in almost unmitigated
 tribulation, her sorrow shewed signs of abatement; whereupon, suit
 being made for her hand by some of the greatest men of Lombardy,
 her brothers and other kinsfolk began to importune her to marry
 again. Times not a few, and with floods of tears, she refused; but,
 overborne at last, she consented to do as they would have her, upon
 the understanding that she was to remain unmarried until the term
 for which she had bound herself to Messer Torello was fulfilled.</p><h3>[Voice:

						Now the lady's affairs being in this posture at Pavia, it befell
 that some eight days or so before the time appointed for her marriage,
 Messer Torello one day espied in Alexandria one that he had
 observed go with the Genoese ambassadors aboard the galley that
 took them to Genoa; wherefore he called him, and asked him what
 sort of a voyage they had had, and when they had reached Genoa.

						Which report believing--and
 'twas indeed most true--and calling to mind that in a few days the
 term that he had asked of his wife would be fulfilled, and surmising
 that there could be no tidings of him at Pavia, Messer Torello made
 no question but that the lady was provided with another husband;
 whereby he sank into such a depth of woe that he lost all power to
 eat, and betook him to his bed and resigned himself to die.  <a name="068" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=068#068">[

 and, having chidden him not a little that he had not sooner apprised

 and rings and girdles, and other things, which 'twere tedious to
 enumerate, he disposed around him.  <a name="087" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=087#087">[

						Which done, he kissed Messer
 Torello again, and bade the necromancer speed him on his journey.
 Whereupon, forthwith, the bed, with Messer Torello thereon, was
 borne away from before Saladin's eyes, and he and his barons
 remained conversing thereof.</p><h3>[Voice:

						The bed, as Messer Torello had requested, had already been
 deposited in the church of San Piero in Ciel d'Oro at Pavia, and
 Messer Torello, with all the aforesaid jewels and ornaments upon
 and about him, was lying thereon, and still slept, when, upon the
 stroke of matins, the sacristan came into the church, light in hand,
 and presently setting eyes on the sumptuous bed, was not only
 amazed, but mightily terrified, insomuch that he turned back, and
 took to flight. Which the abbot and monks observing with no small
 surprise, asked wherefore he fled; and he told them. Whereupon:
  <a name="089" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=089#089">[

			“ 
		Oh,
			” 
		 quoth the abbot, 
			“ 
		thou art no longer a child, nor
 yet so new to this church, that thou shouldst so lightly be appalled:
 go we now, and see who it is that has given thee this childish fright.
			” 
		<a name="090" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=090#090">[ 
							090

						So, with a blaze of torches, the abbot, attended by his monks, entered
 the church, and espied this wondrous costly bed whereon the knight
 slept, and while, hesitant and fearful, daring not to approach the bed,
 they scanned the rare and splendid jewels, it befell that, the efficacy
 of the potion being exhausted, Messer Torello awoke and heaved a
 great sigh.  <a name="091" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=091#091">[ 
							091

						Whereat the monks and the abbot quaking and crying
 out: 
			“ 
		Lord, help us!
			” 
		 one and all took to flight.  <a name="092" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=092#092">[ 
							092
							]</a>
						Messer Torello,
 opening his eyes and looking about him, saw, to his no small satisfaction,
 that without a doubt he was in the very place where he had craved of
 Saladin to be; so up he sate, and taking particular note of the
 matters with which he was surrounded, accounted the magnificence
 of Saladin to exceed even the measure, great though it was, that he
 already knew.  <a name="093" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=093#093">[ 
							093

						However, he still kept quiet, save that, perceiving
 the monks in flight, and surmising the reason, he began to call the
 abbot by name, bidding him be of good courage, for that he was his
 nephew, Torello.  <a name="094" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=094#094">[ 
							094

						Whereat the abbot did but wax more terrified,
 for that he deemed Torello had been many a month dead; but, after
 a while, as he heard himself still called, sound judgment got the
 better of his fears, and making the sign of the cross, he drew nigh
 Torello;  <a name="095" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=095#095">[

			“ 
		Father, what is't you fear? By
 God's grace I live, and hither am come back from overseas.

						Whom,
 for all he had grown a long beard and was dressed in the Saracenic
 fashion, the abbot after a while recognized, and now, quite reassured,
 took by the hand, saying: 
			“ 
		Son, welcome home:
			” 
		 then: 
			“ 
		No
 cause hast thou to marvel at our fears,
			” 
		 he went on, 
			“ 
		seeing that
 there is never a soul in these parts but firmly believes thee to be
 dead, insomuch that I may tell thee that Madonna Adalieta, thy wife,
 overborne by the entreaties and menaces of her kinsfolk, and against
 her will, is provided with another husband, to whom she is this
 morning to go, and all is made ready for the nuptials and the
 attendant festivities.

						Whereupon Messer Torello, being risen from the sumptuous
 bed, did the abbot and the monks wondrous cheer, and besought
 them, one and all, to tell never a soul of his return, until he had
 completed something that he had on hand. After which, having
 put the costly jewels in safe keeping, he recounted to the abbot all
 the story of his adventures to that very hour.  <a name="098" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=098#098">[

						The abbot, rejoicing
 in his good fortune, joined with him in offering thanks to God.
 Messer Torello then asked him who might be his wife's new husband,
 and the abbot told him.  <a name="099" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=099#099">[

						Quoth then Messer Torello:
 
			“ 
		Before my return be known, I purpose to see how my wife will
 comport herself at the nuptials: wherefore, though 'tis not the wont
 of men of religion to go to such gatherings, I had lief that for love of
 me you arranged for us to go thither together.
			” 
		<a name="100" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=100#100">[ 
							100

						The abbot answered
 that he would gladly do so, and as soon as 'twas day, he sent word
 to the bridegroom that he had thoughts of being present at his
 nuptials, accompanied by a friend; whereto the gentleman made
 answer that he was much gratified.  <a name="101" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=101#101">[ 
							101
							]</a>
						So, at the breakfast hour Messer
 Torello, dressed as he was, hied him with the abbot to the bridegroom's
 house, as many as saw them gazing on him with wonder,
 but none recognizing him, and the abbot giving all to understand
 that he was a Saracen sent by the Soldan as ambassador to the King
 of France.  <a name="102" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=102#102">[ 
							102
							]</a>
						Messer Torello was accordingly seated at a table directly
 opposite that of his lady, whom he eyed with exceeding great delight,
 the more so that he saw that in her face which shewed him that she
 was chagrined by the nuptials. She in like manner from time to time
 bent her regard on him; howbeit, what with his long beard, and his
 foreign garb, and her firm persuasion that he was dead, she had still
 no sort of recollection of him.  <a name="103" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=103#103">[ 
							103
							]</a>
						However, Messer Torello at length
 deemed it time to make trial of her, whether she would remember
 him; wherefore he took the ring that the lady had given him on his
 departure, and keeping it close in the palm of his hand, he called to
 him a page that waited upon her, and said to him:  <a name="104" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=104#104">[

			“ 
		Tell the
 bride from me that 'tis the custom in my country, that, when a
 stranger, such as I, eats with a bride, like herself, at her wedding-feast,
 she, in token that he is welcome to her board, sends him the
 cup from which she herself drinks, full of wine; and when the
 stranger has drunk his fill, he closes the cup, and the bride drinks
 what is left therein.

		</p><h3>[Voice:

						The page carried the message to the lady, who, being of good
 understanding and manners, and supposing him to be some very great
 man, by way of shewing that she was gratified by his presence,
 commanded
 that a gilt cup, that was on the table before her, should be
 rinsed, and filled with wine, and borne to the gentleman.  <a name="106" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=106#106">[ 
							106

						Which
 being done, Messer Torello, having privily conveyed her ring into
 his mouth, let it fall (while he drank) into the cup on such wise that
 none wist thereof; and leaving but a little wine at the bottom, closed
 the cup and returned it to the lady;  <a name="107" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=107#107">[ 
							107
							]</a>
						who, having taken it, that she
 might do full honour to the custom of her guest's country, lifted
 the lid, and set the cup to her mouth; whereby espying the ring,
 she thereon mutely gazed a while, and recognizing it for that which
 she had given Messer Torello on his departure, she steadfastly
 regarded the supposed stranger, whom now she also recognized.
 Whereupon well-nigh distracted, oversetting the table in front of
 her, she exclaimed: 
			“ 
		'Tis my lord, 'tis verily Messer Torello;
			” 
		<a name="108" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=108#108">[

						and rushing to the table at which he sate, giving never a thought to
 her apparel, or aught that was on the table, she flung herself upon
 it; and reaching forward as far as she could, she threw her arms
 about him, and hugged him; nor, for aught that any said or did,
 could she be induced to release his neck, until Messer Torello himself
 bade her forbear a while, for that she would have time enough
 to kiss him thereafter.  <a name="109" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=109#109">[ 
							109

						The lady then stood up, and for a while all
 was disorder, albeit the feast was yet more gladsome than before by
 reason of the recovery of so honourable a knight: then, at Messer
 Torello's entreaty, all were silent, while he recounted to them the
 story of his adventures from the day of his departure to that hour,
 concluding by saying that the gentleman who, deeming him to be
 dead, had taken his lady to wife, ought not to be affronted, if he,
 being alive, reclaimed her.  <a name="110" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=110#110">[

						The bridegroom, albeit he was somewhat
 crestfallen, made answer in frank and friendly sort, that 'twas
 for Messer Torello to do what he liked with his own.  <a name="111" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov1009&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=111#111">[

						The lady
 resigned the ring and the crown that her new spouse had given her,
 and put on the ring she had taken from the cup, and likewise the
 crown sent her by the Soldan; and so, forth they hied them, and
 with full nuptial pomp wended their way to Messer Torello's house;
 and there for a great while they made merry with his late disconsolate
 friends and kinsfolk and all the citizens, who accounted his
 restoration as little short of a miracle.</p><h3>[Voice:

						Messer Torello, having bestowed part of his rare jewels upon
 him who had borne the cost of the wedding-feast, and part on the
 abbot, and many other folk; and having by more than one messenger
 sent word of his safe home-coming and prosperous estate to Saladin,
 acknowledging himself ever his friend and vassal, lived many years
 thereafter with his worthy lady, acquitting himself yet more courteously

						Such, then, was the end of the troubles of
 Messer Torello and his dear lady, and such the reward of their
 cheerful and ready courtesies.</p><h3>[Voice:
