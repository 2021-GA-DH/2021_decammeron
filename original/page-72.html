						The priest of Varlungo lies with Monna Belcolore: he
 leaves with her his cloak by way of pledge, and
 receives from her a mortar. He returns the mortar,
 and demands of her the cloak that he had left in pledge,

						Ladies and men alike commended
	Gulfardo for the check that
	he gave to the greed of the Milanese lady; but before they had
	done, the queen turned to Pamfilo, and with a smile bade him follow

						Fair my ladies, it occurs to
	me to tell you a short story, which reflects no credit on those by
	whom we are continually wronged without being able to retaliate, to
	wit, the priests, who have instituted a crusade against our wives, and
	deem that, when they have made conquest of one of them, they have
	done a work every whit as worthy of recompense by remission of sin
	and punishment as if they had brought the Soldan in chains to Avignon:
	<a name="004" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=004#004">[ 
							004
							]</a>
						in which respect 'tis not possible for the hapless laity to be
	even with them: howbeit they are as hot to make reprisals on the
	priests' mothers, sisters, mistresses, and daughters as the priests to
	attack their wives. <a name="005" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=005#005">[ 
							005

						Wherefore I am minded to give you, as I may
	do in few words, the history of a rustic amour, the conclusion whereof
	was not a little laughable, nor barren of moral, for you may also
	gather therefrom, that 'tis not always well to believe everything
	that a priest says.</p>

						I say then, that at Varlungo, a village hard by here, as all of you,
 my ladies, should wot either of your own knowledge or by report,
 there dwelt a worthy priest, and doughty of body in the service of
 the ladies: who, albeit he was none too quick at his book, had no lack
 of precious and blessed solecisms to edify his flock withal of a
 Sunday under the elm. <a name="007" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=007#007">[ 
							007
							]</a>
						And when the men were out of doors, he
 would visit their wives as never a priest had done before him, bringing
 them feast-day gowns and holy water, and now and again a bit of
 candle, and giving them his blessing. <a name="008" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=008#008">[ 
							008
							]</a>
						Now it so befell that among
 those of his fair parishioners whom he most affected the first place
 was at length taken by one Monna Belcolore, the wife of a husbandman
 that called himself Bentivegna del Mazzo. <a name="009" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=009#009">[ 
							009

						And in good sooth
 she was a winsome and lusty country lass, brown as a berry and
 buxom enough, and fitter than e'er another for his mill. Moreover
 she had not her match in playing the tabret and singing: <em>The
 borage is full sappy</em>,
      
and in leading a brawl or a breakdown, no
 matter who might be next her, with a fair and dainty kerchief in her
 hand. <a name="010" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=010#010">[ 
							010
							]</a>
						Which spells so wrought upon Master Priest, that for love
 of her he grew distracted, and did nought all day long but loiter
 about the village on the chance of catching sight of her. And if of
 a Sunday morning he espied her in church, he strove might and main
 to acquit himself of his <em>Kyrie</em> and <em>Sanctus</em> in the style of a great
 singer, albeit his performance was liker to the braying of an ass:
 whereas, if he saw her not, he scarce exerted himself at all. However,
 he managed with such discretion that neither Bentivegna del
 Mazzo nor any of the neighbours wist aught of his love. 
      <a name="011" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=011#011">[ 
							011
							]</a>
						And
 hoping thereby to ingratiate himself with Monna Belcolore, he from
 time to time would send her presents, now a clove of fresh garlic, the
 best in all the country-side, from his own garden, which he tilled with
 his own hands, and anon a basket of beans or a bunch of chives or
 shallots; <a name="012" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=012#012">[ 
							012
							]</a>
						and, when he thought it might serve his turn, he would 
give
 her a sly glance, and follow it up with a little amorous mocking
 and mowing, which she, with rustic awkwardness, feigned not to
 understand, and ever maintained her reserve, so that Master Priest
 made no headway.</p><h3>[Voice:

						Now it so befell that one day, when the priest at high noon was
 aimlessly gadding about the village, he encountered Bentivegna del
 Mazzo at the tail of a well laden ass, and greeted him, asking him
 whither he was going. 
<a name="014" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=014#014">[

			“

			” 
		 quoth Bentivegna, 
			“ 
		for sure
 'tis to town I go, having an affair or two to attend to there; and I
 am taking these things to Ser Buonaccorri da Ginestreto, to get him
 to stand by me in I wot not what matter, whereof the justice
 o' th' coram has by his provoker served me with a pertrumpery
 summons to appear before him.

						Whereupon: 
			“ 
		'Tis well, my
 son,
			” 
		 quoth the priest, overjoyed, 
			“ 
		my blessing go with thee: good
 luck to thee and a speedy return; and harkye, shouldst thou see
 Lapuccio or Naldino, do not forget to tell them to send me those
 thongs for my flails.

			“ 
		It shall be done,
			” 
		 quoth Bentivegna, and
 jogged on towards Florence, while the priest, thinking that now was
 his time to hie him to Belcolore and try his fortune, put his best
 leg forward, and stayed not till he was at the house, which entering,
 he said: 
			“ 
		God be gracious to us! Who is within?

		<a name="017" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=017#017">[

						Belcolore,
 who was up in the loft, made answer: 
			“ 
		Welcome, Sir; but what
 dost thou, gadding about in the heat?

			“ 
		Why, as I hope for
 God's blessing,

		I am just come to stay with thee a
 while, having met thy husband on his way to town.

						Whereupon
 down came Belcolore, took a seat, and began sifting cabbage-seed
 that her husband had lately threshed. By and by the priest began:
 
			“ 
		So, Belcolore, wilt thou keep me ever a dying thus?
			” 
		<a name="020" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=020#020">[

			“

 not to do to thee that which I had lief, and which God commands.

			“

 wish me so well, why do me not a service? and I would then be
 at your command.

 and to get my spinning-wheel put in order: lend me but five
 pounds--I know you have them--and I will redeem my perse

 saints' days, and that I had when I was married--you see that
 without them I cannot go to church or anywhere else, and then I

			“

 them. Think you to serve me as you served Biliuzza, whom you

			“ 
		Prithee,

 the priest, 
			“ 
		send me not home just now. For, seest thou, 'tis the
 very nick of time with me, and the coast is clear, and perchance it
 might not be so on my return, and in short I know not when it
 would be likely to go so well as now.

						The priest, therefore, seeing that she was
 not disposed to give him what he wanted, as he was fain, to wit, on
 his own terms, but was bent upon having a quid pro quo, changed
 his tone; and: 
			“ 
		Lo, now,
			” 
		 quoth he, 
			“ 
		thou doubtest I will not
 bring thee the money; so to set thy mind at rest, I will leave thee
 this cloak--thou seest 'tis good sky-blue silk--in pledge.

 her head and glancing at the cloak: 
			“ 
		And what may the cloak be
 worth?

		 quoth Belcolore.

			“

		 ejaculated the priest: 
			“ 
		I
 would have thee know that 'tis all Douai, not to say Trouai,
 make: nay, there are some of our folk here that say 'tis Quadrouai; and
 'tis not a fortnight since I bought it of Lotto, the secondhand
 dealer, for seven good pounds, and then had it five good soldi
 under value, by what I hear from Buglietto, who, thou knowest,
 is an excellent judge of these articles.

						So Master Priest, being ready for
 action, doffed the cloak and handed it to her. And she, having
 put it in a safe place, said to him:

		Now, Sir, we will away to
 the hut; there is never a soul goes there;

 her to his sacred person, solaced himself with her no little while.</p><h3>[Voice:

						Which done, he hied him away in his cassock, as if he were come
 from officiating at a wedding; but, when he was back in his holy
 quarters, he bethought him that not all the candles that he received
 by way of offering in the course of an entire year would amount to
 the half of five pounds, and saw that he had made a bad bargain,
 and repented him that he had left the cloak in pledge, and cast
 about how he might recover it without paying anything.

 he did not lack cunning, he hit upon an excellent expedient, by
 which he compassed his end. So on the morrow, being a saint's
 day, he sent a neighbour's lad to Monna Belcolore with a request
 that she would be so good as to lend him her stone mortar, for that
 Binguccio dal Poggio and Nuto Buglietti were to breakfast with
 him that morning, and he therefore wished to make a sauce.

 their meal, called his clerk, and said to him:

						The clerk took the mortar to Belcolore's house, where, finding her
 at table with Bentivegna, he set the mortar down and delivered the
 priest's message. <a name="043" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=043#043">[

						Whereto Belcolore would fain have demurred;
 but Bentivegna gave her a threatening glance, saying: 
			“ 
		So, then,
 thou takest a pledge from Master Priest? By Christ, I vow, I
 have half a mind to give thee a great clout o' the chin. Go, give
 it back at once, a murrain on thee! And look to it that whatever
 he may have a mind to, were it our very ass, he be never denied.

						So, with a very bad grace, Belcolore got up, and went to the wardrobe,
 and took out the cloak, and gave it to the clerk, saying:
 
			“ 
		Tell thy master from me: Would to God he may never ply pestle
 in my mortar again, such honour has he done me for this turn!
			” 
		<a name="045" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=045#045">[

						So the clerk returned with the cloak, and delivered the message to
 Master Priest; who, laughing, made answer: 
			“ 
		Tell her, when
 thou next seest her, that, so she lend us not the mortar, I will not
 lend her the pestle: be it tit for tat.
			”

						Bentivegna made no account of his wife's words, deeming that
 'twas but his chiding that had provoked them. But Belcolore was
 not a little displeased with Master Priest, and had never a word to say
 to him till the vintage; after which, what with the salutary fear in
 which she stood of the mouth of Lucifer the Great, to which he
 threatened to consign her, and the must and roast chestnuts that he
 sent her, she made it up with him, and many a jolly time they had
 together. <a name="047" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0802&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=047#047">[

						And though she got not the five pounds from him, he put
 a new skin on her tabret, and fitted it with a little bell, wherewith
 she was satisfied.</p><a href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0801&amp;expand=empty&amp;lang=eng" class="prev_link">← Previous</a><a href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0803&amp;expand=empty&amp;lang=eng" class="next_link">Next →</a>
