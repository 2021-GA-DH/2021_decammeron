						A seemly thing it is, dearest ladies, that whatever we do, it be
      begun
      in the holy and awful name of Him who was the maker of all. Wherefore,
      as it falls to me to lead the way in this your enterprise of storytelling,
      I intend to begin with one of His wondrous works, that, by
      hearing thereof, our hopes in Him, in whom is no change, may be
      established, and His name be by us forever lauded. <a name="003" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=003#003">[

						'Tis manifest
      that, as things temporal are all doomed to pass and perish, so within
      and without they abound with trouble and anguish and travail, and
      are subject to infinite perils; nor, save for the especial grace of God,
      should we, whose being is bound up with and forms part of theirs,
      have either the strength to endure or the wisdom to combat their
      adverse influences. <a name="004" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=004#004">[

						By which grace we are visited and penetrated
      (so we must believe) not by reason of any merit of our own, but
      solely out of the fulness of God's own goodness, and in answer to the
      prayers of those who, being mortal like ourselves, did faithfully
      observe His ordinances during their lives, and are now become
      blessed for ever with Him in heaven. To whom, as to advocates
      taught by experience all that belongs to our frailty, we, not daring,
      perchance, to present our petitions in the presence of so great a Judge,
      make known our requests for such things as we deem expedient for
      us. <a name="005" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=005#005">[

						And of His mercy richly abounding to usward we have further
      proof herein, that, no keenness of mortal vision being able in any
      degree to penetrate the secret counsels of the Divine mind, it
      sometimes,
      perchance, happens, that, in error of judgment, we make one
      our advocate before His Majesty, who is banished from His presence
      in eternal exile, and yet He to whom nothing is hidden, having
      regard rather to the sincerity of our prayers than to our ignorance or
      the banishment of the intercessor, hears us no less than if the intercessor
      were in truth one of the blest who enjoy the light of His
      countenance. <a name="006" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=006#006">[

						The story goes, then, that Musciatto Franzesi, a great and
      wealthy merchant, being made a knight in France, and being to
      attend Charles Sansterre, brother of the King of France, when he
      came into Tuscany at the instance and with the support of Pope
      Boniface, found his affairs, as often happens to merchants, to be
      much involved in divers quarters, and neither easily nor suddenly to
      be adjusted; wherefore he determined to place them in the hands of
      commissioners, and found no difficulty except as to certain credits
      given to some Burgundians, for the recovery of which he doubted
      whether he could come by a competent agent; <a name="008" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=008#008">[ 
							008
							]</a>
						for well he knew
      that the Burgundians were violent men and ill-conditioned and
      faithless; nor could he call to mind any man so bad that he could
      with confidence oppose his guile to theirs. <a name="009" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=009#009">[ 
							009
							]</a>
						After long pondering
      the matter, he recollected one Ser Ciapperello da Prato, who much
      frequented his house in Paris. Who being short of stature and very
      affected, the French who knew not the meaning of Cepparello, 
      but supposed that it meant the same as Cappello, i. e. garland, in their
      vernacular, called him not Cappello, but Ciappelletto by reason of his
      diminutive size; and as Ciappelletto he was known everywhere,
      whereas few people knew him as Ciapperello. <a name="010" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=010#010">[ 
							010
							]</a>
						Now Ciappelletto's
      manner of life was thus. He was by profession a notary, and his
      pride was to make false documents; he would have made them as
      often as he was asked, and more readily without fee than another
      at a great price; few indeed he made that were not false, and great
      was his shame when they were discovered. <a name="011" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=011#011">[ 
							011
							]</a>
						False witness he bore,
      solicited or unsolicited, with boundless delight; and, as oaths were in
      those days had in very great respect in France, he, scrupling not to
      forswear himself, corruptly carried the day in every case in which he
      was summoned faithfully to attest the truth. <a name="012" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=012#012">[ 
							012
							]</a>
						He took inordinate
      delight, and bestirred himself with great zeal, in fomenting ill-feeling,
      enmities, dissensions between friends, kinsfolk and all other folk;
      and the more calamitous were the consequences the better he was
      pleased. <a name="013" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=013#013">[ 
							013
							]</a>
						Set him on murder, or any other foul crime, and he never
      hesitated, but went about it with alacrity; he had been known on
      more than one occasion to inflict wounds or death by preference
      with his own hands. <a name="014" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=014#014">[ 
							014
							]</a>
						He was a profuse blasphemer of God and His
      saints, and that on the most trifling occasions, being of all men the
      most irascible. He was never seen at church, held all the sacraments
      vile things, and derided them in language of horrible ribaldry.
      On the other hand he resorted readily to the tavern and other
      places of evil repute, and frequented them. He was as fond of
      women as a dog is of the stick: in the use against nature he had
      not his match among the most abandoned. He would have pilfered
      and stolen as a matter of conscience, as a holy man would make an
      oblation. Most gluttonous he was and inordinately fond of his
      cups, whereby he sometimes brought upon himself both shame and
      suffering. He was also a practised gamester and thrower of false
      dice. <a name="015" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=015#015">[

						But why enlarge so much upon him? Enough that he was,
      perhaps, the worst man that ever was born.</p><h3>[Voice: 
			panfilo
			]</h3><p>The rank and power of Musciatto Franzesi had long been this
 reprobate's mainstay, serving in many instances to secure him considerate
 treatment on the part of the private persons whom he
 frequently, and the court which he unremittingly, outraged. <a name="016" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=016#016">[ 
							016
							]</a>
						So
 Musciatto, having bethought him of this Ser Cepparello, with whose
 way of life he was very well acquainted, judged him to be the very
 sort of person to cope with the guile of the Burgundians. He therefore
 sent for him, and thus addressed him: <a name="017" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=017#017">[ 
							017

			“ 
		Ser Ciappelletto, I am,
 as thou knowest, about to leave this place for good; and among
 those with whom I have to settle accounts are certain Burgundians,
 very wily knaves; nor know I the man whom I could more fitly
 entrust with the recovery of my money than thyself. Wherefore, as
 thou hast nothing to do at present, if thou wilt undertake this
 business, I will procure thee the favour of the court, and give thee a
 reasonable part of what thou shalt recover.
			” 
		<a name="018" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=018#018">[ 
							018
							]</a>
						Ser Ciappelletto, being
 out of employment, and by no means in easy circumstances, and
 about to lose Musciatto, so long his mainstay and support, without
 the least demur, for in truth he had hardly any choice, made his
 mind up and answered that he was ready to go. So the bargain was
 struck. <a name="019" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=019#019">[ 
							019
							]</a>
						Armed with the power of attorney and the royal letters
 commendatory, Ser Ciappelletto took leave of Messer Musciatto and
 hied him to Burgundy, where he was hardly known to a soul. He
 set about the business which had brought him thither, the recovery
 of the money, in a manner amicable and considerate, foreign to his
 nature, as if he were minded to reserve his severity to the last.
 <a name="020" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=020#020">[ 
							020
							]</a>
						While thus occupied, he was frequently at the house of two
 Florentine usurers, who treated him with great distinction out of
 regard for Messer Musciatto; and there it so happened that he fell
 sick. The two brothers forthwith placed physicians and servants in
 attendance upon him, and omitted no means meet and apt for the
 restoration of his health. <a name="021" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=021#021">[ 
							021
							]</a>
						But all remedies proved unavailing; for
 being now old, and having led, as the physicians reported, a disorderly
 life, he went daily from bad to worse like one stricken with a
 mortal disease. This greatly disconcerted the two brothers; <a name="022" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=022#022">[ 
							022
							]</a>
						and one
 day, hard by the room in which Ser Ciappelletto lay sick, they began
 to talk about him; saying one to the other: <a name="023" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=023#023">[ 
							023

			“ 
		What shall we do
 with this man? We are hard bested indeed on his account. If we
 turn him out of the house, sick as he is, we shall not only incur grave
 censure, but shall evince a signal want of sense; for folk must know
 the welcome we gave him in the first instance, the solicitude with
 which we have had him treated and tended since his illness, during
 which time he could not possibly do aught to displease us, and yet
 they would see him suddenly turned out of our house sick unto
 death. <a name="024" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=024#024">[

						On the other hand he has been so bad a man that he is sure
 not to confess or receive any of the Church's sacraments; and dying
 thus unconfessed, he will be denied burial in church, but will be cast out
 into some ditch like a dog; <a name="025" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=025#025">[ 
							025

						nay, 'twill be all one if he do confess, for
 such and so horrible have been his crimes that no friar or priest either
 will or can absolve him; and so, dying without absolution, he will
 still be cast out into the ditch. <a name="026" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=026#026">[ 
							026

						In which case the folk of these parts,
 who reprobate our trade as iniquitous and revile it all day long, and
 would fain rob us, will seize their opportunity, and raise a tumult,
 and make a raid upon our houses, crying: 'A way with these Lombard
 dogs, whom the Church excludes from her pale;' and will certainly
 strip us of our goods, and perhaps take our lives also; so that in any
 case we stand to lose if this man die.

						Ser Ciappelletto, who, as we said, lay close at hand while they

						The two brothers
	had not much hope of the result, but yet they went to a friary and
	asked for a holy and discreet man to hear the confession of a Lombard

	for, being wont to fast not only in Lent like other devout persons, but
	at least three days in every week, taking nothing but bread and water,
	he had quaffed the water with as good a gusto and as much enjoyment,

	seemed to him meet in one who fasted, as he did, for devotion.

	waxen images which they had dedicated. <a name="088" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=088#088">[

						And the fame of Ciappelletto's
	holiness and the devotion to him grew in such measure that
	scarce any there was that in any adversity would vow aught to any
	saint but he, and they called him and still call him San Ciappelletto,
	affirming that many miracles have been and daily are wrought by
	God through him for such as devoutly crave his intercession.</p><div>

						So lived, so died Ser Cepperello da Prato, and came to be reputed
	a saint, as you have heard. Nor would I deny that it is possible that
	he is of the number of the blessed in the presence of God, seeing
	that, though his life was evil and depraved, yet he might in his last
	moments have made so complete an act of contrition that perchance
	God had mercy on him and received him into His kingdom. But,
	as this is hidden from us, I speak according to that which appears,
	and I say that he ought rather to be in the hands of the devil in hell
	than in Paradise. <a name="090" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=090#090">[

						Which, if so it be, is a manifest token of the
	superabundance of the goodness of God to usward, inasmuch as He
	regards not our error but the sincerity of our faith, and hearkens
	unto us when, mistaking one who is at enmity with Him for a
	friend, we have recourse to him, as to one holy indeed, as our intercessor
	for His grace. <a name="091" href="DecShowText.php?myID=nov0101&amp;expand=&amp;lang=it&amp;highlight=091#091">[

						Wherefore, that we of this gay company
	may by His grace be preserved safe and sound throughout this time
	of adversity, commend we ourselves in our need to Him, whose
	name we began by invoking, with lauds and reverent devotion and
	good confidence that we shall be heard.</p>
